## Farjax

React web application. Connects with the stockpull API

## Description 

This project grabs and displays the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) closing prices on a 5-minute window. It then applies historical data to estimate the price for the next 5 minute window. It displays these in chart and table form, and tracks accuracy (within 50 cents of the estimate). This is based loosely on an experiment and is not financial advice, yada yada.

Do not use this project, because unlike us, it lacks standards

## Usage

Create a .env file, and add this line

REACT_APP_API_URL=[STOCKPULL_API]
